Bioimage Informatics Image Analysis tasks (02740 CMU)

Image Analysis performed using binning and kernal comparison evaluation (max binning, average binning, guassian kernal, box kernal, sharpen kernal)~ hw1
Performed histogram image analysis, homogenity, glcm, contrast, entropy~ hw2
Trained, tested and evaluated a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Pytorch modules~ hw3
Trained an Auto encoder model and also performed image segmentation analysis using geometric segmentation algorithms (edge based, cluster based, region based). Worked with Tensorflow~ hw4
Trained a Variational Auto encoder model using Pytorch~ hw5
